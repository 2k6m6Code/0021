	Those need not specified can be left empty. Area means an ISP or a physical port. After defining the criteria in the filter, select one of the classes in the class ID pull down menu. (The items available for selections are ones defined in Class Definition.) There can be cases where two filters overlap, this is where the priority takes effect.<br> 
	Alternatively, there is a form dynamic QoS to be set here. Please fill in the fields, such as Burst, Overrun Class ID. When the instantaneous traffic flow exceeds that of the burst, it can be redirected to another class, the overrun class.
