<h4>Documentation Download Center Lite</h4>
<p> Thank you for your interest in our Download Center Lite. We recommend to 
 			read this documentation carefully.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p> Download Center Lite has been configured in a way that makes it ready to use. 
 			You only need to upload all script files to your web server. When you 
 			intend to edit the script you should do it step by step. After each 
 			change you should run the script to monitor the effects. Doing so 
 			enables you to know what change eventually causes an error.
 
</p>
<p> The HTML templates of the script have been generated by the specifications of 
 			XHTML 1.0. HTML tags like &lt;br&gt; or &lt;input&gt; contain an ending slash (&lt;br /&gt; 
 			or &lt;input type=“text“ name=“field“ /&gt;).
 
 
</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"> Back To Top
</a></p></div>
<div class="chapter"><a name="function"></a>
<h4>Function and Features</h4>
<p> Download Center Lite enables you to offer file downloads of any file type on 
 			your website. The script delivers the file to the visitor. Once you have 
 			installed the script, you need to put a link to the script on one page of 
 			the website. That link contains the path to the index.php file of the 
 			script as well as the file name of the download file as parameter. Example:
 
</p>
<p class="code"> &lt;a href=&quot;/download_center/index.php?file_name.txt&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;
 
</p>
<p> The script can be used in two ways. First you can use it, if you want to hide the 
 			real path to your download folder on your web server. You can prevent direct 
 			access to the download folder.
 
</p>
<p> And second you can make sure that your visitors get the "Save as" dialogue. That 
 			prevents file types like PDF, HTML, TXT or Microsoft Office documents from 
 			opening instantly.
 
</p>
<p> You can use the Download Center Lite to provide any file type you can think of. 
 			The files in the folder "downloads" are examples for the common file types.
 
</p>
<p> The script provides also the possibility to log and count all downloads. The 
 			logging feature writes all downloads in a file. You will get information 
 			about IP address, host name, file name, date, time, referring site and 
 			user agent.
 
</p>
<p> You are also able to count the downloads. That feature writes filename, number of 
 			downloads for that file, date and time of the first and the latest download.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
</p>

</a></p></div>
<div class="chapter"><a name="configuration"></a>
<h4>Set up and configuration</h4>
<p> The file "index.php" can be viewed as the configuration file of the script. It 
 			is possible to duplicate the file and set it up in a different manner. 
 			That enables you to run several download centers with the same script core.
 
</p>
<p> The following variables can be edited:

 						to link to the script. If you enter the name of your

 						authorized to link to your download files.

<h4>HTML template customization</h4>
<p> Changes in the HTML template file are only needed, if you want to display a customized 
 			error message or some other information like a link to your homepage to your 
 			visitors.
 
</p>
<p> The directory "templates" contains the files for the layout. You can use HTML and CSS 
 			to customize the layout as you wish.
 
</p>
<p> In case you are using a WYSIWYG editor like Macromedia Dreamweaver, MS Frontpage or 
 			NetObjects Fusion please make sure that the software does not make any changes 
 			by itself.
 
</p>
<p> The template files contain markers with { and } like: {txt_next_page}. These markers 
 			will be replaced by its counterparts from the language file 
 			"languages/language.en.inc.php". You are free to edit that file and change the 
 			words and phrases. You are also free to replace the markers within the template 
 			files by real words or put those markers to other positions within the template 
 			file. And you are also able to enhance the language file by using the given pattern. 
 
</p>
<p> Amongst those word markers exist the so called Loops. Similar to HTML tags the two 
 			parts (&lt;LOOP …&gt;…&lt;/LOOP&gt;) must not be separated. If you want to alter the 
 			position within the template you move the hole block.

<div class="chapter"><a name="upload"></a>
<h4>Upload script files</h4>
<p> Create the following folder on your web server (with the most FTP clients you are able 
 			just to copy the hole script with all folders in one go):
 
</p>
<pre>
 /download_center_lite/
 /download_center_lite/downloads/
 /download_center_lite/inc/
 /download_center_lite/languages/
 /download_center_lite/log/
 /download_center_lite/templates/
 
</pre>
<p> Copy all files to their corresponding folder. Image files (.gif, .jpg, .png) have to 
 			be uploaded in binary mode. Every other files have to be uploaded in ASCII mode 
 			(text mode).
