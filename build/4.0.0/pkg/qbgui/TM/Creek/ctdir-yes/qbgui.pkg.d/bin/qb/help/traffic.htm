<h2>Link Status</h2>

<li>Historical traffic</li>
<p>

	The graph reports ISPs' inbound/outbound traffics in kilobytes per second, calculated over five-minute intervals. Therefore, each dot on the graph represents data from the last five minutes. Due to the limited space in Q-Balancer, only the data from the last 36 hours are kept. Logs, however, can be transferred to another machine. Please refer to Administrative parameters for details.

<li>Manual Query</li>
<p>
 

	This graphs the same ISP flow history as the auto refresh does, but you can specify which time frame it drew. 
</p>
<li>Real Time Traffic</li>
<p> 

	This bar graph shows the ISP traffic flow for the moment. The left bar and the right bar represent the instantaneous traffics and the accumulated traffics respectively. If an ISP is highlighted in red as shown in ISP 3 on the figure above, it means that the Link Check has determined the link to be down.
