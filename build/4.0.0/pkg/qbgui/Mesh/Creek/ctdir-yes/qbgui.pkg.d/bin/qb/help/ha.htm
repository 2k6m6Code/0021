<h2>High Availability</h2>
<ol>
<li>HA Topology</li><!-- 1 -->
<p>
In HA mode, the primary initially works as an active, the secondary works as a standby. When the primary one fails, the secondary will turns to active mode. And then the original primary becomes the standby. Console cable and Ethernet cable are needed to detect the operation of Q-balancer.
</p>
<li>Setup High Availability</li><!-- 2 -->
<p>
The primary one has the configuration files for the active mode and standby mode. So does the secondary. This means four configuration files are need when setting up HA for Q-Balancer. The files between the primary and the secondary are identical. The active one, the primary or the secondary, communicates with others with the floating IP. When the equipment turns to the standby, it will use the standby IP, such as standby IP of primary and standby IP of secondary.

The following steps are the procedure for setup:<br>
<ol>
<li>In the Primary, config a file for the active mode and save as "PRACT."
<li>In the Primary, config a file for the standby mode and save as "PRSTD."
<li>In "CONFIG SET" on UI, assign the file "PRACT" for Active and assign the file "PRSTD" for standby.
<li>Setup the Floating IP, standby IP of primary, and standby IP of secondary.
<li>In the Secondary, config a file for the active mode and save as "SECACT."
<li>In the primary, config a file for the active mode and save as "SECSTD."
<li>In "CONFIG SET" on UI, assign the file "SECACT" for Active and assign the file "SECSTD" for standby.
<li>Setup the Floating IP, standby IP of primary, and standby IP of secondary
</ol>
