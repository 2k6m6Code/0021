<h2>Top N sessions</h2>
<p>
This list shows the current active sessions. For each session, details including ingress/egress data are shown. These sessions can be sorted according to the amount of ingress/egress traffics. Show Top arranges them in order and shows the top N entries. Export Log can export these data to CSV text file format. Toggle Display Mode changes the display window size.
