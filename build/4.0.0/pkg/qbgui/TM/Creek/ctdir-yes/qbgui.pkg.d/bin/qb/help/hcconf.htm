<h2>Line Health Check</h2>
<p>
<b>Configuration Parameters Explained:</b>
<table>
<tr><td rowspan=4 valign=top>Health Check Method :</td><td><li>By Ping</td><td rowspan=4 valign=top>Configure ways to detect link failures. ICMP packets can be sent to test using ping, traceroute(L3). Or alternatively checks can be done by testing destination port(L4).</td></tr> 
<tr><td><li>By Ping And Trace Route</td></tr>	
<tr><td width=220><li>By Connection to Specified Port</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>By Connection And Trace Route</td></tr>	
</table></p><p>
<table>
<tr><td rowspan=6 valign=top>Advanced Setting :</td><td valign=top width=180>	Disable Passive Line Check</td><td>This checks if physical ports have packets going through (such as tcp ack). If there are packets from a gateway, the link is determined to be up.</td></tr> 
<tr><td valign=top class="light">	Port	</td><td class="light">The TCP port number to test.</td></tr> 
<tr><td valign=top>	Ping Time Out</td><td>The timeout value for the ping test. In the ping test, timeout twice to determine a failure. </td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top class="light">	Traceroute Time Out</td><td class="light">Timeout value for the traceroute test. Consecutive three timeout to determine a failure. </td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>	Connection Time Out</td><td>Timeout value for the connection test. Timeout twice to determine a failure.</td></tr> 
<tr><td valign=top class="light">	Check Time Interval</td><td class="light">Time lapse between two tests. </td></tr>
</table></p>
<p>
If it is intended to determine link failure as quickly as possible, how fast does it get?<br>
	If by ping only, 3+3+time interval (0~3) makes it 6 to 9 seconds.<br>
</p>
<p>
If ping and traceroute (after a single ping test failed, traceroute is tested three times), 3+traceroute(3+3+3)+time interval(0~3) makes it approximately 12-15 seconds. 
</p><p>
Some balance algorithms are in themselves a type of link check, and works independently to direct traffics out of broken link without explicitly waiting for determining link failure.
