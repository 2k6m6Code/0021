###############################################################################

# TAG: ppp
#	Path to the pppd program, default '/usr/sbin/pppd' on Linux
#
speed 115200
ppp /usr/sbin/pppd

# TAG: option
#	Specifies the location of the PPP options file.
#	By default PPP looks in '/etc/ppp/options'
#
option /etc/ppp/options.pptpd

# TAG: debug
#	Turns on (more) debugging to syslog
#
#debug

# TAG: stimeout 200
#	Specifies timeout (in seconds) on starting ctrl connection
#
stimeout 200

# TAG: noipparam
#       Suppress the passing of the client's IP address to PPP, which is
#       done by default otherwise.
#
#noipparam

# TAG: logwtmp
#	Use wtmp(5) to record client connections 100
#
#logwtmp

# TAG: bcrelay <if>
#	Turns on broadcast relay to clients from interface <if>
#
#bcrelay eth1

# TAG: delegate
#	Delegates the allocation of client IP addresses to pppd.
#
#       Without this option, which is the default, pptpd manages the list of
#       IP addresses for clients and passes the next free address to pppd.
#       With this option, pptpd does not pass an address, and so pppd may use
#       radius or chap-secrets to allocate an address.
#
#delegate

# TAG: connections 100
#       Limits the number of client connections 100
#
#       If pptpd is allocating IP addresses (e.g. delegate is not
#       used) then the number of connections 100
#       remoteip 192.168.1.30-100
connections 100

# TAG: localip
# TAG: remoteip 192.168.1.30-100
#	Specifies the local and remote IP address ranges.
#
#	These options are ignored if delegate option is set.
#
#       Any addresses work as long as the local machine takes care of the
#       routing.  But if you want to use MS-Windows networking, you should
#       use IP addresses out of the LAN address space and use the proxyarp
#       option in the pppd options file, or run bcrelay.
#
#	You can specify single IP addresses seperated by commas or you can
#	specify ranges, or both. For example:
#
#		192.168.0.234,192.168.0.245-249,192.168.0.254
#
#	IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
#
#	1. No spaces are permitted between commas or within addresses.
#
#	2. If you give more IP addresses than the value of connections 100
#	   it will start at the beginning of the list and go until it
#	   gets connections 100
#
#	3. No shortcuts in ranges! ie. 234-8 does not mean 234 to 238,
#	   you must type 234-238 if you mean this.
#
#	4. If you give a single localIP, that's ok - all local IPs will
#	   be set to the given one. You MUST still give at least one remote
#	   IP for each simultaneous client.
#
# (Recommended)
localip 192.168.1.254
remoteip 192.168.1.30-100
